# ConsumerPanelTestSystem
The Consumer Panel Test System is a Web-Based application geared towards creating an organized and systematic market research process. 
The authorization of specific users to submit requests, the multi-level approval process, as well as the automated creation of all 
necessary forms ensure a seamless and refined process. The application allows selected users to submit CPT requests - a request for 
the execution of Consumer Panel Test surveys (market research tools) on consumers. 

The process is systemized with regulated approvals of requests, as well as the creation of the survey questionnaires simply by selecting 
a flexible questionnaire type. Data collection is another major feature of the application, as the collected data is stored into the 
system's database instantly. Collected results are verified on multiple levels to ensure accuracy and consistency, and the Consumer Panel 
Test System allows the auto-generation of graphs based on results, as well as rapid decision making through the system. In short, 
the application caters towards a hierarchal approach to market research, as well as rapid appraisal and decision making.
